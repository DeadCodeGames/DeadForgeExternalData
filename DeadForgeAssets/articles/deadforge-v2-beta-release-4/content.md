## 🔧 What's Changed?

### Bug Fixes
Previously, DEADFORGE would install outdated versions of software. This was accidentally left in from testing software updates. This has been removed and fixed :3

### Software Uninstalls
We have a couple big changes to DEADFORGE. One of them are software uninstalls! You can now uninstall anything from DEADFORGE Store directly from DEADFORGE (but why would you ever want to do that anyway, riiight? :'3)

### DEADFORGE Settings and Updates
The Settings page also got a couple overhauls.
