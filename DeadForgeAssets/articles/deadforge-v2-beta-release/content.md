After 2 months of work, DeadForge is finally ready for its first Beta release, and we are excited to share this news with you.

In this article, we'd like to share more information about the Beta release, its features, and what is coming in the foreseeable future.

However, first and foremost, we would like to highlight, that **this is an experimental Beta release**, and things are not fully stable yet. We would also like to mention, that **autoupdate is not yet implemented. Once an update releases, we will release an article with a downloading link.** Thank you for your patience. Now, let's get into it...

## “What is DeadForge?”
DeadForge is a **multi-purpose software launching tool.** Currently, as of release 2.0.0-Beta-1, DeadForge supports semi-automatic imports from:
- [Steam](https://www.steampowered.com/)
- [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/)
- [itch.io](https://www.itch.io/)

More storefront support is currently on our backlog, and you can request more storefronts to be supported, as well as make any other suggestions regarding DeadForge, see the _“How can I contribute?”_ section.

### “How does this work?”
If you are interested in knowing how this works, here is a very quick overview:
1. During the initial setup, you can tell DeadForge where you Steam, Epic, and itch clients are installed.
2. DeadForge will use those paths to find your installed games, and import them into DeadForge.
- If a storefront required DRM, DeadForge will prompt you to open the storefront's client before opening the game.
3. Voilà, your games are now all in one place.

## “What is currently in DeadForge?”
As of release 2.0.0-Beta-1, we have implemented:
- the basic library page, with complete support for Steam-style manual collections
- elegant grid views of all your games
- launching your games directly from DeadForge
- customizable UI/UX via the Settings page (including ✨localization✨)

## “What is planned for DeadForge in the very near future?”
- many UX fixes and optimizations
- autoupdates - autoupdate is not currently implemented, as signified by the disabled switches in the Settings page. we have disabled these options, because we are working on creating an autoupdate strategy, which would be as network efficient as possible
- a notification system
- gradual localization updates (see the _“How can I contribute?”_ section)
- **DeadForge Store** - one stop place for all software from DeadCode, directly from DeadForge
- game stats display, similar to Steam's
- more storefronts support - currently, on our backlog is:
  - [HoYoPlay](https://hoyoplay.hoyoverse.com/)
  - [Riot Client](https://www.riotgames.com/)
  - [GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/app)
  - [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/)
    - GameBanana does not have an official desktop client, but we are still considering it
  - [Ubisoft Connect](https://www.ubisoft.com/ubisoft-connect/)
  - [EA Play](https://www.ea.com/ea-play/)
  - **Custom game imports**
- DiscordRPC support
- more library management options, including editing launcher paths directly from the library (_you know, where your games are displayed???_), and Game Joins (_patent and trademark pending_)
