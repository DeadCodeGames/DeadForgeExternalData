After 2 months of work, DeadForge is finally ready for its first Beta release, and we are excited to share this news with you. We will update this article ASAP, _however_, **for now**, this is it.

We will share more information about the Beta release, its features, and what is coming in the foreseeable future in this article very soon. So stay tuned!

With love,
[Richard](https://github.com/RichardKanshen), the lead developer of DeadForge.

P.S. Happy Pride Month!
