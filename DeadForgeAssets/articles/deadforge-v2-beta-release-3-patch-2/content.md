Another quick update coming your way! Yet again, I've noticed some bugs RIGHT AFTER dropping the last update. _sigh._ So uhh, here is what I'm working on.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This update is still a work-in-progress.** This article is being used to test new features - some things might not render as expected, including new video tags that are coming in this update.
> If something does not seem right with this article, and you are on version Beta-3-Patch-1, this is probably normal. However, if you aren't... plz update thank you :3

## 🔧 What's Being Fixed

### Game State Detection Issues
We've identified and are addressing several bugs related to game state detection that were causing DEADFORGE to sometimes miss when games were launched or closed. This should make play time tracking much more reliable.

### Language Selector Flag Bug
We've noticed an annoying issue where the flag in the language selector wouldn't update immediately when you changed languages. Previously, you had to navigate away from settings and back again to see the correct flag.

![On the not so low chance that the video above is not rendering for you because you are on Beta-3-Patch-1 or lower, here is how it looks like](https://deadcode.is-a.dev/DeadForgeExternalData/articles/deadforge-v2-beta-release-3-patch-2/languageselectorflagstuckframe.jpg)
This patch will address this issue. (A fix has already been found :3)

### Some weird link issues
There are actually _**two**_ issues with links in DeadForge.
1. **Within the sidebar** - CTRL-clicking or Shift-clicking any of the links in the sidebar opens them in the browser.
2. **From the Store page** - CTRL-clicking or Shift-clicking any of the links on the Store page opens them in a new DEADFORGE window.
Good news - **A fix for both of these issues has been found!** All in this new update.

## 🎬 New Features in Testing

This work-in-progress build includes experimental **video, audio, and embed support** for articles. Once Beta-3-Patch-2 is released, you’ll start seeing some new video elements integrated into updates like this — though they’re still being refined and tested on our end.

Remember, this is a work-in-progress, and this article is actively being edited and used as a testing ground. Thanks for understanding!

As always, thanks for your patience as we continue to improve DEADFORGE! 🚀

With ❤️ and continuous development,
