Another quick update coming your way! We're making steady progress on Beta-3-Patch-2, and while it's not quite ready for prime time, we wanted to share what we've been working on.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This update is still a work-in-progress.** This article is being used to test new features - some things might not render as expected, including new video tags that are only implemented in this WIP update.

## 🔧 What's Being Fixed

### Game State Detection Issues
We've identified and are addressing several bugs related to game state detection that were causing DEADFORGE to sometimes miss when games were launched or closed. This should make play time tracking much more reliable.

### Language Selector Flag Bug
Fixed an annoying issue where the flag in the language selector wouldn't update immediately when you changed languages. Previously, you had to navigate away from settings and back again to see the correct flag. This patch will address this issue.

## 🎬 New Features in Testing

This work-in-progress build includes experimental **video, audio, and embed support** for articles. Once Beta-3-Patch-2 is released, you’ll start seeing some new video elements integrated into updates like this — though they’re still being refined and tested on our end.
