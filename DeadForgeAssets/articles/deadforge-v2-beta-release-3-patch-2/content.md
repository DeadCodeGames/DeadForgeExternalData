Another quick update coming your way! Yet again, I've noticed some bugs RIGHT AFTER dropping the last update. _sigh._ So uhh, here is what I'm working on.

## üîß What's Being Fixed

### Game State Detection Issues
We've identified and are addressing several bugs related to game state detection that were causing DEADFORGE to sometimes miss when games were launched or closed. This should make play time tracking much more reliable.

### Language Selector Flag Bug
We've noticed an annoying issue where the flag in the language selector wouldn't update immediately when you changed languages. Previously, you had to navigate away from settings and back again to see the correct flag.

This patch will address this issue. (A fix has already been found :3)

## üé¨ New Features in Testing

This work-in-progress build includes experimental **video, audio, and embed support** for articles. Once Beta-3-Patch-2 is released, you‚Äôll start seeing some new video elements integrated into updates like this ‚Äî though they‚Äôre still being refined and tested on our end.

Remember, this is a work-in-progress, and this article is actively being edited and used as a testing ground. Thanks for understanding!

As always, thanks for your patience as we continue to improve DEADFORGE! üöÄ
