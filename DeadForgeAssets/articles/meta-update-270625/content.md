hi again :3

we got our report cards today and the school year is finally over, which means more time to code and work on projects and stuff

## sooooo what does that mean?

- the project die team can hopefully focus on that
- more deadforge updates more frequently (ooooo you will download the new deadforge update coming this monday ooooo)
- some mini projects i had in mind
- some tools to make both the deadforge developers', aka mine, and deadforge admins', aka mine and peter's, lives easier

so yeah :3 thank you for sticking with deadforge

im gonna go eat some pizzer in a while now
