That's it for this quick patch! Short and sweet, just like we promised. The main Beta-3 features (game updates, play time tracking, and the refreshed home screen) are all working smoothly.

Next up: extended tray functionality and more exciting features as we continue development with our newfound summer freedom! 🌞

With ❤️ and rapid bug-squashing,
