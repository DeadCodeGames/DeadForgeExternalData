## üîß What's Changed?

### More Homepage Layout Tweaks
I could try to explain this, but... I'll just let the clip speak for itself.

YES, THE LAST PLAYED ROW SHRINKS WHEN YOU SCROLL THROUGH THE ARTICLES LIST. I am very, very happy with how this turned out, and while it might not look just as impressive on video, it will look fabulous in practice. Trust.

### Fixed a bug with 
I haven't noticed this until now, but there were _two_ small bugs with the `GameCard`s sprinkled in throughout the Library and Homepage.
1. A single missing image would result into a fallback state, even though there were more possible allowed images present.

2. The algorithm for choosing the right image would not handle different locale options correctly, as shown in the following side-by-side showcase:

Both of these bugs have been fixed.

## Small note on DEADFORGE's update schedule
After a bit of thought, I have decided, that a new ‚ú® BIG FEATURE UPDATE ‚ú® every 2 weeks would be the best idea, both to make sure DEADFORGE is alive, and that I am as well. This should give me enough time to work on features, localization, and touch grass from time to time as well.

As always, thanks for your patience as we continue to improve DEADFORGE! üöÄ
