We're back with another quick update! This time it's **DEADFORGE v2.0.0-Beta-2-Patch-1-LangPack-1** (seriously, these version tags are getting absolutely ridiculous at this point lol).

This is primarily a **language pack update** with some small fixes thrown in. Nothing too groundbreaking, but hey - progress is progress, right?

**You can download this release from [our GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/DeadCodeGames/DeadForge/releases/tag/v2.0.0-Beta-2-Patch-1-LangPack-1)**.

## 🌍 Localization Updates

### New Strings Added

We've added several new translatable strings to improve the overall user experience from the Initial Setup screen.

### Bug Fixes

Fixed a slightly annoying typo in library.install.noReleaseinfo (I just now noticed that the i is lowercase uuuggghhhhh)
**From**: Software {{id}} is missing release information
**To**: Software with ID {{id}} is missing release information

### Current Translation Progress

Here's where we stand with our localization efforts:

- 🇸🇰 Slovenčina, 🇨🇿 Čeština - 100%
- 🇯🇵 日本語 - 76%
- 🏴‍☠️ Pirate English - 7%
- 🇰🇷 한국어, 🇨🇳 简体中文, 🇹🇼 繁體中文 - 5%
- 🇫🇷 Français, 🇮🇹 Italiano - 3%
- 😹 LOLCAT - 1%
- 🇩🇪 Deutsch - <1%

#### 🤝 Help Us Translate!

If you speak any of the languages that are sitting at low completion percentages, we'd absolutely love your help! Even if you can only contribute a few strings here and there, it makes a huge difference.

## 🌱 Some info about what is going on outside of the IDE I am writing this article as well as all of DEADFORGE source code in

If the emoji next to the title is not good enough of a hint, yes. We are gonna be touching grass for some time lmao. The entirety of DeadCode Team is going on a 4-day school trip. _Wwwhhhiiiccchhh mmmeeeaaannnsss_ no DEADFORGE updates for u whoopsies :3

_We are planning to do a little vlog video to explain some stuff, where DeadCode is headed, some of our planned future projects, and maybe even some behind-the-scenes secrets (no promises). Stay tuned for that!_

## 🚀 What's Coming Next

We're not slowing down anytime soon... well, we are for the next couple of days but ykwim! Here's what's brewing in the DEADFORGE kitchen:

### Immediate Priorities

- **Game update functionality** - This is still our #1 missing feature from the store
- **Extended tray functionality** - Launch games directly from your system tray
- **More localization push** - We're actively seeking translators for the languages that are lagging behind

### Slightly Further Out

- Full autoupdate implementation (because manually downloading updates is so 2010)
- Additional storefront support - We're looking at osu!, HoYoPlay, and Riot Client integration
- DiscordRPC integration for all you status flex enthusiasts. I stand with you, my friends 🙏

## 🙏 Thank You

Big thanks to everyone or anyone who is using DEADFORGE :3

Keep being awesome!

With ❤️ and slightly less caffeine this time,
[Richard](https://github.com/RichardKanshen), **lead developer of DEADFORGE**.
